## 🔄 Development Approach
The system is developed using the **Incremental Model**, where:
1. User Registration and Login are implemented first.
2. Movie and Show Listing is added next.
3. Ticket Booking functionality is integrated.
4. Seat Blocking and Admin features are implemented in later increments.

Each increment delivers a working version of the system.

- Email Notifications for Booking Confirmation
- Enhanced UI Design
- Real-time Seat Synchronization
- Role-based Access Control
